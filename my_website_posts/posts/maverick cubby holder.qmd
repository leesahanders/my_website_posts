Cut on the laser cutter at the Boulder, Colorado Solid State Depot Makerspace. 

# Recommended software: 

## Libre CAD <https://librecad.org/>

This is where the bulk of your work will be done. Some of the key functions to be aware of: 

- Line, 2 points
- Measure, distance point to point
- Modify, Move/Copy, Rotate, Trim 2, Attributes, Explode text into letters, Mirror

Tips: 

- You'll need to change the snap settings at the bottom to change what it connects with. 
- When drawing a line use the @ symbol to signify from the current reference (instead of absolute). EG. @0,10
- Your actual cut layer should be its own layer separate from a designs / motifs layer. 

In order to move your files (`.dxf`) into your next software (where it will be layed out on a page for the actual laser cutter to interpret), it will need to be saved/exported (as an `.svg`). 

## Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>

This is where your design is laid out for the laser cutter to cut.
