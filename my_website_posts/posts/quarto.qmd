The obligatory starting template with a couple links.

## Quarto blogs

It's a whole new exciting world! And the default project has a lot of exciting files to explore.

I'm using:

-   <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html>

## Quarto

## Example

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
